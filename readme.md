Unfortunately, did not get a whole lot accomplished at this month's meetup.
Goal was to maybe put together rainfall/precipitation data along with fire data from last summer's Colorado wildfires and visualize it in D3.

This is as far as I got. This can also be found at [this gist](http://gist.github.com/4544449).

TODO:
Maybe next month we can keep working on this.
